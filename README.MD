## Architecture: MVC

**MVC** stands for Model, View, Controller.

**Model:** This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to expose the data to the Controller.

**View:** It represents the UI (REST API) of the application devoid of any Application Logic.

**Controller:** It acts as an interface between the Model and the View.
